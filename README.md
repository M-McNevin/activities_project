# ðŸŽˆ While'd Child <br>


### About

While'd Child is a web app to help busy parents and caregivers plan fun and engaging activities for the children in their lives. 
While there are no end of websites with activity ideas, it takes time to sort through ideas. If you find a promising post, you still have to
download all the ads and pictures, close the pop ups,  scroll down through blogger's personal story to pick out the activity steps and then 
determine if you have the right materials for the activity on hand or if your kids would even be interested. 

I created Whileâ€™d Child to help solve these problems!

### Structure

Install PostgreSQL and Python. <br>
Clone or fork this repo. <br>
Set up and activate a python virtualenv, and install all dependencies. <br>
