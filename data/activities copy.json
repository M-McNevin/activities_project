When you combine baking soda and vinegar, there are two reactions. First, there is a double displacement reaction forming sodium acetate and carbonic acid. The second reaction, a decomposition reaction, produces carbon dioxide, also known as the bubbles.  Because the bubbles weigh more than air, they collect and overflow, which is the fun part!",
